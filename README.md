aquaponics-jeenode
==================

This code is for use with aqua-wireless-node-red. It is intended for installation on any number of jeenodes with different sensors attached. The keenodes then broadcast the sensor readings in a way that can be interpreted by the code in aqua-wireless-node-red.

To tailor it to a particular sensor or combination of sensors, edit the relevant (marked) section in the main program.

The included libraries (all open source and easily available) will hopefully make it clear which sensor chips are supported. But if anything is unclear, please feel free to raise an issue here, or to email us.
