==================

Jeenode code for wireless aquaponics sensors

The current system is to have a configurator sketch that sets parameters such as the sensors connected, the ports/pins used and the node id.

These parameters don't change during the lifetime of the sensors.

After setting these parameters, the main sketch is loaded, and this runs forever.

This should be regarded as beta code under active development.

We welcome feature request, bug reports, feedback of all sorts etc.
